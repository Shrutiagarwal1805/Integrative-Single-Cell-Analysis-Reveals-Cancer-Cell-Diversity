# Single-cell RNA Data Integration using Seurat and Harmony

This project focuses on integrating single-cell RNA sequencing data using the Seurat and Harmony packages in R. Single-cell RNA sequencing allows for the exploration of cellular heterogeneity, and data integration is crucial for combining datasets from different experiments or conditions. Seurat is a popular R package for single-cell data analysis, and Harmony is used for batch correction and data integration. This project demonstrates how to effectively integrate multiple datasets to achieve a unified analysis.
